## Poke API Project
## Overview
This project is a simple web application designed to interact with the PokeAPI, a free and open API that provides information about Pokémon. The primary purpose of this project was to practice and demonstrate my ability to fetch and display data from external APIs using JavaScript. Additionally, the application implements infinite scrolling, loading more Pokémon as the user reaches the bottom of the page.

## Features
* Fetch Pokémon Data: Retrieve data from the PokeAPI and display it in a user-friendly format.
* Infinite Scrolling: Automatically load more Pokémon as the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.
* Responsive Design: Ensures the application looks great on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
  
## Technologies Used
* HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
* CSS3: For styling and layout.
* JavaScript: For fetching data from the API and adding interactivity.
* PokeAPI: The external API used to retrieve Pokémon data.
